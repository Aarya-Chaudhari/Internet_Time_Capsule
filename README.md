# Internet_Time_Capsule
A secure, animated time capsule app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Supports future-date locking, password verification, and countdown timer.
Internet Time Capsule is a creative and interactive web application that allows users to write personal messages to their future selves and lock them until a specific date. The capsule remains hidden until the set unlock date, featuring a live countdown timer to build anticipation. Users can also secure their messages with an optional password and even download them once revealed. It’s a great blend of nostalgia, privacy, and technology.

The project is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with smooth animations (via AOS) and elegant UI transitions. It stores capsules locally using the browser’s localStorage, making it entirely client-side and offline-capable. Whether you want to reflect on your goals, record a memory, or send a surprise to your future self — this fun tool makes it possible in a beautifully designed interface.
